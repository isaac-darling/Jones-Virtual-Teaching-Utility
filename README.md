# virtual-teaching-utility

It is a GUI based program to help teachers complete menial virtual learning tasks who would otherwise have to navigate to third party websites and software. 

## Notes:

(Circa September 2020)  
This was the first program I wrote in Java, and I worked on it with a good friend of mine who was also a novice at the time. We had just started AP Computer Science A as seniors in high school, and decided to get a little ahead.
